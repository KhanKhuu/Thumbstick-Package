# Thumbstick


First, add the assets loacted at https://github.com/KhanKhuu/Thumbstick/tree/master/Thumbstick to your project. The package doesn't contain them (packages don't support this), but it does use them. 

[ Optionally, you could use your own custom images for the joystick by just modifying the image-adding lines in the Thumbstick.swift and SampleViewController.swift files. ]

See sample view controller for how to instantiate and locate the Thumbstick in your project or just use it as a template and add your code. Enjoy!
